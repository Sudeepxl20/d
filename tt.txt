1. Definition of Cloud Computing and Cloud Service Models & Deployment Models

Cloud Computing refers to the delivery of computing resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics over the internet (the cloud). Instead of owning and maintaining physical hardware or software, cloud computing allows users to access resources and applications on-demand, paying only for what they use. This model provides flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency.

Cloud Service Models:

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): This model provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It includes the basic building blocks of cloud IT, such as virtual machines, storage, and networks. AWS EC2 is an example of IaaS.

Platform as a Service (PaaS): PaaS offers hardware and software tools over the internet, primarily for application development. Users do not need to manage the underlying infrastructure but can focus on building applications. AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an example of PaaS.

Software as a Service (SaaS): SaaS delivers software applications over the internet. Users can access applications via web browsers, without worrying about installation or management. Google Workspace and AWS WorkDocs are examples of SaaS.

Cloud Deployment Models:

Public Cloud: Services and resources are provided over the internet by third-party providers and are accessible by multiple customers.

Private Cloud: The cloud infrastructure is exclusively used by a single organization, providing more control and security.

Hybrid Cloud: A combination of public and private clouds that allows for data and applications to be shared between them, offering more flexibility.

Community Cloud: Shared infrastructure for a specific community of users, with similar concerns, often used for research organizations or governmental bodies.

2. Advantages of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing offers numerous benefits to businesses and individuals:

Cost Efficiency: No need to purchase hardware or maintain infrastructure. Users only pay for what they use, reducing capital expenditures.

Scalability: Cloud resources can be easily scaled up or down depending on demand, ensuring that businesses have the right amount of resources at all times.

Flexibility and Mobility: Users can access cloud services from anywhere, allowing for remote work and increased collaboration.

Reliability and Availability: Cloud providers ensure that services are highly available with minimal downtime, offering backup and disaster recovery options.

Security: Major cloud providers implement robust security measures, including encryption and compliance with regulations.

Automatic Updates: Cloud providers regularly update their infrastructure, software, and security features, saving organizations the time and effort of manual updates.

3. AWS Global Infrastructure Components

AWS has built a global network of infrastructure to support its services. The key components of AWS infrastructure include:

Regions: Geographical areas that contain multiple Availability Zones (AZs).

Availability Zones (AZs): Physically separate locations within a region, designed for fault tolerance.

Edge Locations: Locations for caching content and improving user access speed globally.

Data Centers: Physical facilities where AWS hardware is housed and managed.

4. AWS Global Infrastructure Components

i) Regions: AWS Regions are large geographic areas containing multiple Availability Zones. A region is a separate geographic area that provides customers with a localized set of resources to meet regulatory, compliance, and latency requirements. For example, North Virginia (us-east-1) and Frankfurt (eu-central-1).

ii) Availability Zones: Availability Zones (AZs) are distinct data centers within a region, each with its own power, networking, and cooling systems. AZs allow for high availability and fault tolerance, as workloads can be distributed across multiple zones.

iii) Edge Locations: These are locations close to users that cache content to improve response times. They are typically used for content delivery via AWS CloudFront and are spread globally to ensure fast access to resources.

iv) CloudFront: AWS CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that uses a network of edge locations to deliver content to users with low latency. CloudFront speeds up the distribution of static and dynamic content, reducing time for loading websites and applications.

5. AWS Services and Service Categories

AWS offers a broad range of services categorized into different areas:

Compute Services: These include Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk, and more, providing computing resources for running applications.

Storage Services: AWS provides scalable storage options like Amazon S3 and Elastic Block Store (EBS) for data storage needs.

Database Services: Services like Amazon RDS and DynamoDB provide relational and NoSQL database solutions.

Networking: Amazon VPC, Route 53, and Direct Connect are services to help manage network connections and resources.

Machine Learning: AWS offers tools such as SageMaker and Rekognition to build, train, and deploy machine learning models.

Security, Identity, and Compliance: AWS IAM, KMS, and AWS Shield help secure resources and manage access.

6. Storage Services (EBS & S3)

Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) provides persistent block-level storage for EC2 instances. It is ideal for applications that require frequent updates, such as databases and file systems. EBS volumes can be easily attached, detached, and backed up.

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service that provides highly scalable storage for unstructured data, such as media files, backups, and logs. S3 allows easy access, backup, and retrieval of data from anywhere.

7. Nine Key Decisions When Creating an EC2 Instance Using the AWS Management Console

Instance Type: Choose the appropriate instance based on CPU, memory, storage, and networking requirements.

Amazon Machine Image (AMI): Select an AMI that contains the operating system and software configurations.

Key Pair: Select or create a key pair for SSH access to the instance.

Network and Subnet: Specify the VPC and subnet for network isolation.

Security Group: Define firewall rules that control inbound and outbound traffic.

Storage: Decide on the type and size of EBS volumes.

IAM Role: Assign an IAM role if the EC2 instance requires AWS services access.

Monitoring: Enable CloudWatch monitoring to track performance and usage.

Tags: Assign tags for easier management and organization of resources.

8. Categories of Compute Services

Virtual Servers (EC2): Instances that provide flexible, on-demand computing capacity.

Serverless (AWS Lambda): AWS Lambda allows you to run code without provisioning servers.

Containerized Services (Amazon ECS & EKS): Use containers for microservices-based architecture.

Elastic Beanstalk: Managed environment for deploying applications, abstracting infrastructure management.

9. AWS Elastic Beanstalk

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a PaaS offering that simplifies the deployment and management of applications in the cloud. Developers simply upload their code, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, scaling, monitoring, and load balancing of the application. It supports a variety of programming languages and frameworks.

10. AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code in response to events without managing servers. Lambda automatically scales the application based on the number of requests. It is ideal for applications that require short-lived, event-driven processes, such as file processing or backend services.
